**Tema 8: Small Business Discount Network**

**Description**

In this project you should model all the information and transactions managed by a small business discount network.
Small merchants can join the system. Consumers / customers can join the system by receiving a discount card (physical or virtual)
that they use in purchases from affiliated merchants. In each purchase, there is a charge that is charged to the merchant
(for example, 5% of the value of the sale), a part of which is returned to the customer (for example, 3%) and the remainder is
a service charge to pay the maintenance of the system (e.g., 2%). The customer may use his balance on subsequent purchases from
any affiliated merchant. You can also transfer part of your balance to other adherent customers. Customers who get new customers
or merchants who raise new merchants also receive bonuses. Merchants can offer extra discounts on selected products
(increasing the % that reverts  to  the  customer). See:  http://www.boobonus.com/
